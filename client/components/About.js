      <h1>Welcome to Mei Crochet!</h1>
      <p>
        As a software engineer and aspiring crocheter, I wanted to practice
        designing and building an e-commerce site while promoting my favorite
        crochet patterns.

        Feel free to add items to your cart and checkout. No account or credit
        card needed, this site’s just for fun! On checkout, you’ll receive a
        summary with links to all the crochet patterns you wanted, which you can
        visit if you'd like to purchase them for real. There are plenty of free
        patterns to enjoy as well.

        Crochet is a wonderful way to unwind, reflect, and slow down. It brings
        together a lot of great things — a community of creative artists, an
        appreciation for slow (sometimes *really* slow) fashion, and handmade
        gifts from the heart. Nothing says "I love you" like spending hours
        picking out the perfect yarn and colors, crocheting alongside a true
        crime Youtube playlist, and weaving in dozens of ends. Happy crocheting!
      </p>
      <p>With much love, Kristin</p>
