            I'm Kristin, software engineer and aspiring crocheter. I wanted to
            hone my coding chops while making a groovy website and sharing my
            love for crochet. It's the best of both worlds!
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            Crochet is a wonderful way to unwind, reflect, and slow down. It
            brings together a lot of great things â€” a community of creative
            artists, an appreciation for slow (sometimes *really* slow) fashion,
            and handmade gifts from the heart. I hope you find your next project
            here!
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">Happy crocheting, Kristin</p>
