# Mei Crochet

Mei Crochet is an e-commerce practice site where you can browse some of my favorite crochet patterns. Created with the intention of promoting crochet artists while I practice with frontend and backend frameworks, you can interact with the site as both a guest and user. Upon checking out, you'll see an order summary that displays links to purchase the patterns, which you can visit to support the artists.

This app was created with React, Redux, Express, and Sequelize with a PostgreSQL database. For authentication, JWT and Bcrypt were used. Lastly, Tailwind CSS was used for styling.
